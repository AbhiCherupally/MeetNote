# 🚨 Backend Authentication Issue - Quick Diagnosis

## Problem:
- Login works (creates JWT) ✅  
- All protected endpoints fail with "Could not validate credentials" ❌
- Health check hangs ❌

## Root Cause:
**Database connection issue** during JWT validation - backend can't lookup user to validate token.

## Quick Test Commands:

### Test 1: Basic Health
```bash
curl -w "@-" -s "https://meetnote-backend.onrender.com/api/health" <<< "Response time: %{time_total}s\nHTTP: %{http_code}"
```

### Test 2: Database-Free Endpoint
```bash
curl "https://meetnote-backend.onrender.com/"  # Should work if backend is up
```

### Test 3: Login (No DB Read)  
```bash
curl -X POST "https://meetnote-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "abhi@meetnote.app", "password": "abhi@123"}'
```

## Likely Solutions:
1. **Restart backend service** (Render dashboard)
2. **Check environment variables** (JWT_SECRET, DATABASE_URL)  
3. **Database connection timeout** - wait and retry

## Immediate Action:
- Go to Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com/
- Find meetnote-backend service
- Check logs for database connection errors
- Try manual deploy/restart if needed

The issue is NOT in the extension - it's backend database connectivity.
