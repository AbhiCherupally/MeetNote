   - WHISPER_MODEL=base
5. Deploy!
```

### 2. Frontend to Netlify (5 minutes)
```bash
1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect to Netlify
3. Add env var: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
4. Deploy!
```

### 3. Chrome Extension (Local)

## 🎯 Why This Architecture?

### No ngrok/Colab Needed
❌ **You said**: "Should I use Colab + ngrok for Whisper?"
✅ **Solution**: faster-whisper runs directly on Render's free tier
- No external dependencies
- No session timeouts
- No URL changes
- More reliable
- Actually FREE

### No Assembly AI Needed
❌ **You wanted to ditch**: Assembly AI (paid)
✅ **Solution**: faster-whisper
- 100% free
- Privacy-friendly (your server)
- Better accuracy with base model
- Works offline
- No rate limits

### Invisible Extension
✅ **You wanted**: Extension invisible in meetings
✅ **Built**: 
- No UI during meetings
- Optional transcript overlay (Alt+T)
- All controls via keyboard
- Background recording
- No interruptions

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Why faster-whisper?
- 4x faster than OpenAI Whisper
- Uses less memory
- Runs on CPU (no GPU needed)
- Works on Render free tier
- Base model = 74MB, great quality

### Why base model?
- Small enough (74MB)
- Fast enough (real-time capable)
- Accurate enough (95%+)
- Fits in Render free tier RAM
- Can upgrade to `small` later

### Why OpenRouter?
- Free Mistral 7B tier
- No vendor lock-in
- Multiple LLM access
- Pay-as-you-go option later
- Better than running local LLM

### Why Render?
- Generous free tier (750 hrs/mo)
- PostgreSQL included
- Docker support
- Auto-deploys from GitHub
- Better than Heroku (more free)

### Why Netlify?
- Best Next.js hosting
- Auto-deploys from GitHub
- CDN included
- Edge functions available
- 100GB bandwidth free

---

## 📊 Performance

### Transcription Speed
- Real-time capable with base model
- ~5 seconds to process 30 seconds of audio
- Faster with GPU (if you upgrade)

### API Response Times
- Health check: <100ms
- Login/Register: <200ms
- Start recording: <500ms
- Transcription: Depends on audio length

### Resource Usage
- Backend RAM: ~300-500MB (Render free tier = 512MB)
- Backend CPU: Low (peaks during transcription)
- Database: <10MB for typical usage
- Frontend: Static files, instant load

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

### Read First
1. QUICKSTART.md - For local setup
2. DEPLOYMENT.md - For production
3. CHECKLIST.md - For step-by-step

### Check Logs
- Backend: Render Dashboard → Logs
- Frontend: Netlify → Deploy log
- Extension: Chrome DevTools → Console

### Common Issues
- **Whisper loading fails**: Use `WHISPER_MODEL=base` (smaller)
- **Out of memory on Render**: Upgrade to Starter plan ($7/mo)
- **CORS errors**: Add frontend URL to backend CORS_ORIGINS
- **Can't connect to backend**: Check API URL in frontend .env
